        My mother and step dad, Heidi and Al Curry, own a wedding venue that is the barn at our house in Pownal, Maine. There is a wedding almost every weekend through May all the way to the beginning of November. People who get married here are from all over. It is very interesting to see all of the different weddings each weekend. The barn is a blank slate so those who are getting married hire caterers, photographers, florists and many more businesses to come in and get the barn ready.
