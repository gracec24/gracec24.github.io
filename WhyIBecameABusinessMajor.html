<h1> Why I Became a Business Major</h1>

<p>

    My parents have been a huge influence on why I became I business major. Both my parents attended the University of Maine. My Dad majored in Forest Engineering and my Mom majored in Business Finance.
    Growing up my parents have always had their own businesses. My Dad has always owned a timber harvesting and forest management business. I have worked for my Dad for the past four years. My Mom used to have a firewood business and about five years ago started a wedding venue at our house. It has been very cool to grow up with parents owning businesses and I have learned a lot from it. My hope is to one day own my own business and maybe end up taking over my Dads business with one of my brothers who is a mechanic for him.
