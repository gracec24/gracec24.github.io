<p><LI>Hometown: Pownal, Maine </LI>

<LI>Major: Business Finance</LI>

<LI>Family: I have two brothers, two step brothers and two step sisters. My parents got a divorce when I was nine and they have both remarried. My parents now live only a mile apart. </LI>

<LI>Hobbies: Growing up I have always loved the outdoors. Ever since I was about seven years old I have been hunting. I started off by just going to sit with my dad and a few years later started to carry a gun. I also love to spend time on our boat and fish. Growing up we had four wheelers and so my brothers and I would spend a lot of time riding around. </LI>

<LI>Schooling: I went to elementary school in Pownal from pre-k through fifth grade. My class was only twelve kids. For middle school I started going to Freeport and I also went to Freeport High School. In middle school I played basketball. In high school I ran cross country and indoor and outdoor track.</LI>
